# Tailwind CSS Hover Class Issue

This repository demonstrates a bug where Tailwind CSS hover classes are not applied correctly.  The expected behavior is for the div element to change background color to blue on hover. However, it remains red.

## Bug Description

When using Tailwind CSS hover classes, such as `hover:bg-blue-700`, the class is not applied upon hovering. The element maintains its original styling (in this case, `bg-red-500`).

## Solution

The solution involves ensuring that the Tailwind configuration and build process are correctly set up, and that the CSS is correctly being applied to the HTML elements.
